My main files for each step of the project are separated into main1.cc, main2.cc, main3.cc, and main4.cc. All the code for the classes can be found in Population.h, Population.cc, and Person.cc and can be used for any question. The main files are split up as follows:

Exercise 39.1: main1.cc
Exercise 39.2: main2.cc
